Use Cases : 
Here's a complete set of use cases for the Personal Finance Tracker (with Charts) project, structured as real-world scenarios. These will help you:
Understand why each feature matters


Prepare better for interviews (real-world thinking)


Build an app that demonstrates industry-grade product thinking



🧩 Use Cases: Personal Finance Tracker App
🧑‍💼 1. User Registration & Login
Actor: New user
 Goal: Create an account to securely manage finances
 Flow:
User signs up with email and password


JWT token is returned upon successful login

 Auth is required in 90% of web apps. You’ll show experience with JWT, token storage, and auth middleware.

💰 2. Add Income or Expense
Actor: Logged-in user
 Goal: Record a financial transaction
 Flow:
User selects category (e.g., Salary, Rent)


Enters amount, notes, and date


Data is sent to backend and stored in MongoDB


Dashboard updates immediately


✅ Why it matters:
 CRUD operations and state updates are core to frontend/backend dev.

📊 3. View Charts and Summary
Actor: Logged-in user
 Goal: Understand spending habits
 Flow:
Pie chart shows category-wise expenses


Bar chart shows month-wise trends


Cards show income, expenses, and balance


✅ Why it matters:
 Visualization enhances data usability. Employers love when devs can work with real-world datasets and charts.

🗑️ 4. Delete a Transaction
Actor: Logged-in user
 Goal: Remove an incorrect or outdated transaction
 Flow:
User clicks delete icon next to a transaction


API call is made to delete from database


UI updates immediately


✅ Why it matters:
 You’ll work on optimistic UI updates and API data syncing.

🔍 5. Filter by Category or Date
Actor: Logged-in user
 Goal: Analyze specific periods or categories
 Flow:
User selects a date range or category from dropdown


Only matching transactions are shown and chart updates


✅ Why it matters:
 Filtering is essential in admin panels, dashboards, and ecommerce sites.

🧾 6. Transaction History
Actor: Logged-in user
 Goal: Review all past records
 Flow:
Transactions are listed by date


Each entry includes amount, category, type, and notes


Pagination or infinite scroll can be added later


✅ Why it matters:
 Working with long lists, sorting, and pagination shows scalability thinking.

📱 7. Responsive Dashboard Access
Actor: User on mobile
 Goal: Access tracker on the go
 Flow:
UI adapts to screen size


Charts remain interactive


Navigation stays intuitive


✅ Why it matters:
 Mobile-first design is a hiring priority. Tailwind helps here.

🔐 8. Logout & Secure Routes
Actor: Logged-in user
 Goal: Exit the app and protect sensitive data
 Flow:
User clicks logout


Token is cleared


Protected routes redirect to login if no token


✅ Why it matters:
 Protecting user data is non-negotiable. This shows awareness of security best practices.

📤 9. Export Transactions (Bonus)
Actor: User
 Goal: Save backup or send to accountant
 Flow:
User clicks “Export”


Downloads transactions as CSV or PDF


✅ Why it matters:
 Teaches file generation and backend-to-frontend file streaming.
